# ROB-550: BotLab, Team 5

## Description
This repository is the MobileBot section of the code base of the BotLab project in the ROB-550 course. At a high level, running this on a Beagle Bone Blue board allows low level control algorithms to be deployed and tested on a 2 DOF wheeled robot (MBot). 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
* Python 2.7
* C++

### Installing
```
  git clone git@github.com:Aaatresh/team-2-3-mobilebot.git
```

### Executing the code
Run ```mobilebot/mobilebot.c``` to take forward and rotational velocity commands and perform low level control operations. Sensor data is read and odometry data is calculated, before both being published.
